<P><FONT face=Arial>Click where you 
want the arrowheads to be. The first two clicks will honor snapping, if it is on. The third 
point determines the height above the line. Snapping is turned off for this point.&nbsp;If 
you place the annotation first you may click on the center of the text to place 
the arrows in an exact line.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>    
    If the arrowhead 
is not at the cursor you will need to right-click and select Switch Arrowheads. 
If you save the mxd file it will remember which end the arrowheads belong 
on.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><IMG border=0 
hspace=3 alt="" align=left src="dimensionArrowsCurvedCursor0.bmp">You may choose 
zero to four dashes on the arrows by clicking the numbers 0 through 4. Because 
Arc does not show the dashes while the arrows are being manipulated the cursor 
will show you how many dashes will <IMG alt="" align=left

  If the first point is on a map boundary it may choose
